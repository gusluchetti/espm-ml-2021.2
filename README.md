# espm-ml-2021.2

Exercises made for ESPM's Machine Learning Minor (2021.2).

## ESPM_ML_BreastCancer

### The goal of this exercise is to create 3 separate pipelines, where each has preprocessing, attribute engineering and model fitting

### Results: (Recall score for 'bad' diagnosis is most important parameter)

1. KNN w/ hyperparameter optimization = *0.96923*
2. GradientBoosting w/ hyperparameter optimization = *0.93846*
3. RandomForestClassifier w/ hyperparameter optimization = *0.93846*

## ESPM - Machine Learning 2020.2 - Final Project

### Dataset used: (<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/madelon>)

#### Goal: Accuracy >= 70%

1. DecisionTreeClassifier = 73.6%
2. GradientBoostClassifier = 70.2%
3. RandomForestClassifier = 67.7%
4. KNN = 62.5%
5. DecisionTreeClassifier + GridSearch = 55.5
